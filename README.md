# EventsSchedule

The project has the ability to help in the organization of the event.

The project has the ability to store the following information: 
1) Users. These are employees of the company.
2) Offices. This is information about the location of the company's offices.
3) Rooms. This is information about places where events can be held.
4) Events. This is information about the company's events: where and when they will be held, who is the organizer and who is invited to them.

Now the project has the following roles:
1) ADMIN - the main user of this application. He can invite new users and edit any information.
2) HR. He can invite new users (when a new employee gets a job in the company, for example), but he can't edit information that he didn't create himself.
3) USER.
They can all organize events and be invited to others.
